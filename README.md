# sftcli

This is a basic tool that I whipped up because scaleft makes it so darn hard to delete a host without jumping through gui hoops.  This uses the api to delete all hosts of name X from project Y.  It's got lots of things that could improve, but it was primarily a project because I a) needed the tool, and b) wanted to learn golang.
